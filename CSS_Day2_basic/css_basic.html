        <ul>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with
            parchment paper. Draw a 9 inch circle on the parchment. An easy way
            to do this is to draw around the outside of a 9 inch pan with a
            pencil.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks
            form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to whip.
            Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. Mix together the remaining
            1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into meringue with
            lemon juice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread a layer of meringue to fit circle on parchment, approximately
            1/4 inch thick. With remainder of mixture, pipe or spoon swirls
            around the edges to form a shallow bowl shape.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of confectioners
            sugar, and whip until thickened. Decorate with fruit of your choice;
            strawberries are excellent.
          </li>
        </ul>
